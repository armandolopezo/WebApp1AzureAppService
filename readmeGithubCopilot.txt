Workspace: The provided code is a simple Flask web application written in Python. Flask is a lightweight web framework that allows you to build web applications quickly and with minimal code.

First, the code imports the necessary modules from Flask, specifically [`Flask`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2F_VSCODE%2FProjects%2FGithub%2Frepositories%2FWebApp1PythonInAzureAppService%2FWebApp1AzureAppService%2Fapplication.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A18%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FProgram%20Files%2FPython39%2FLib%2Fsite-packages%2Fflask%2Fapp.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A80%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%2231fc13bd-e8c7-48d1-90ae-e01779eb0306%22%5D "Go to definition") and [`redirect`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2F_VSCODE%2FProjects%2FGithub%2Frepositories%2FWebApp1PythonInAzureAppService%2FWebApp1AzureAppService%2Fapplication.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A25%7D%7D%5D%2C%2231fc13bd-e8c7-48d1-90ae-e01779eb0306%22%5D "Go to definition").

Next, the `@app.route("/")` decorator is used to define a route for the root URL ("/"). This means that when a user accesses the root URL of the web application, the [`hello`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2F_VSCODE%2FProjects%2FGithub%2Frepositories%2FWebApp1PythonInAzureAppService%2FWebApp1AzureAppService%2Fapplication.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A5%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%7D%5D%2C%2231fc13bd-e8c7-48d1-90ae-e01779eb0306%22%5D "Go to definition") function will be executed. The [`hello`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2F_VSCODE%2FProjects%2FGithub%2Frepositories%2FWebApp1PythonInAzureAppService%2FWebApp1AzureAppService%2Fapplication.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A5%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%7D%5D%2C%2231fc13bd-e8c7-48d1-90ae-e01779eb0306%22%5D "Go to definition") function returns a multi-line string containing HTML code. This HTML code displays a welcome message and includes a meta tag that automatically redirects the user to "http://mediatech.com.ec/" after 3 seconds.

Finally, the [`if __name__ == "__main__":`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2F_VSCODE%2FProjects%2FGithub%2Frepositories%2FWebApp1PythonInAzureAppService%2FWebApp1AzureAppService%2Fapplication.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%2231fc13bd-e8c7-48d1-90ae-e01779eb0306%22%5D "Go to definition") block ensures that the Flask application runs only if the script is executed directly (not imported as a module). The [`app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2F_VSCODE%2FProjects%2FGithub%2Frepositories%2FWebApp1PythonInAzureAppService%2FWebApp1AzureAppService%2Fapplication.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%7D%5D%2C%2231fc13bd-e8c7-48d1-90ae-e01779eb0306%22%5D "Go to definition") method starts the Flask development server, making the web application accessible on all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) and listening on port 80.

Overall, this code sets up a basic web application that displays a welcome message and redirects users to another website after a short delay.
